### Assignment 1 – Implement HTTP Server and Chat Application  

**October 2, 2025**

---

### Goal  
The objective of this assignment is the application of major components in a computer network, for example, the client-server paradigm, the peer-to-peer paradigm, and network programming.

---

### Content  
In detail, students will practice with three major modules: the client-server HTTP communication, the peer-to-peer based chat application, and the TCP/IP connection, which includes:

- Client processes and server processes  
- Multiple peer processes connecting together  
- TCP socket network programming  

Besides, students will practice the design and implementation of a simple peer-to-peer protocol via TCP/IP.

---

### Result  
After this assignment, students can partly understand the principles of a computer network system.  
They can understand and design the roles of different types of processes, i.e., the server process, client process, and tracker peer process in a network communication.
